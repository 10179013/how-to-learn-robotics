**[RVBUST INC.](http://www.rvbust.com)** was found in 2018.04.09. After interviewed many robotic background applicant, I have found that：**Most graduates from mainland do not have enough robotic comprehensive capacity**。

If we just based on education experience, most students graduated from electromechanics or computer science, and even some robot research LABS, robotics company work experience ,they should be considered as "Professional Players".

Of course, if only based on their work and education -- most of them majored in electromechanics and computer science, and even worked in robotics LABS and robotics companies -- these people should be considered as "professional players."

However, judging from the interviews, most of them didn't have a complete knowledge of robotics. The guy who drew the circuit board didn't know how to analyze the robot's workspace.People in design agencies don't know how to apply dynamics to control;The  guy coding the control algorithm doesn't know what the Configuration Space is;People who do exercise planning don't know what Q-learning is;The partners doing deep reinforcement learning do not know how to make the actual robot move with the control instructions they have learned.

Judging from my learning experience in the past few years, I can understand this phenomenon.When I first entered the school, I took over my senior Bare-foot brother's SmartPal robot.Relying on the "ancestral code" of my senior Bare-foot brother, I also made some demonstrations in front of foreign guests:

However, when I actually started to look at the "ancestral code", I realized that only a few joint ** points had been given to the robot.

**「Where is the PID？？？」**

That was the biggest question I had.This code logic is completely different from the quadrotor, intelligent car and so on that I played during my undergraduate study!
So, with this question, I asked around the people in my lab, no answer.Even then, I took a number of graduate courses in robotics.After a year of study, I still didn't get the answer.

Yes, as one of the first universities to carry out robot research in China, the graduate course of robotics here only teaches us how to establish the DH coordinate system, and the dynamics is just a simple calculation of a plane three-link.There is no control, no trajectory planning, no inverse kinematics.

As far as I know, the same is true of many other institutions.
There is still no complete teaching system for robotics in China. Therefore, most graduates in mainland China have not received a complete systematic education in robotics. They can only master the required content of the project through self-study when they are doing the project.

This has produced a large number of robotics professional master's degree and doctoral degrees tudents who have not calculated the inverse kinematics of the robot.

Of course, this is not to say that "inverse kinematics", "trajectory interpolation" and so on are difficult knowledge.
What I want to emphasize is that on the mainland, a student cannot master or even have access to these very basic knowledge of robotics only through classes.

Of course, this situation is more common in the mainland, and for foreign or Hong Kong and Taiwan university graduates, basically do not have this problem.
The teaching system of robotics in universities abroad or in Hong Kong and Taiwan is relatively complete. Basically, the major assignments will cover the main knowledge points, and most of them require programming.

Although most of the students are "untrained", according to my experience, mainland students are very smart, and with some simple and correct guidance, they can quickly master these knowledge through self-study.
So, let's take a look at how the "untrained" can learn robotics.
