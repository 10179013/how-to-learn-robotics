Now that you know how to get a robot moving, and you have gained some professional knowledge in robotics area. You may imagine yourself as a brave who just killed the first slime, holding a sword, who feels ready to pierce the sword into the chest of the boss dragon at any time.

However, at this moment, someone comes to you and cools you down with the following words:

*"Some recent so-called robot companies spend their money asking people to copy existing schemes, to buy motors and reducers, and to make things work on a universal controller. You waste your time learning all those dynamics, optimal control, and motion planning stuffs at all!*

*"I heard that even in the four major robot companies, the basic knowledge of D-H for robot modeling is enough. At most, you need also to know kinematics calibration, dynamics identification. They put their main focus on application integration. You waste your time learning all those Lie algebra, convex optimization, and and reinforcement learning stuffs at all!"*



They are trying to tell you that "there is not boss dragon in this world".



But what I want to tell you is that, in the case of robots, as long as the manual labors in industry or agriculture are not fully automated, the boss dragon exists:

When you see that most of nowadays' robot are "taught" to work in the way shown in the above figure, you will have this strong feeling: "This is indeed the boss dragon!"

When you see that there are so many different robot companies with different types of robots, different programming languages, different teaching pedants, you will have this strong feeling: "This is indeed the boss dragon!"

When you see that there are still many people of our age who are doing repetitive and boring work in the factory, you will have this strong feeling: "This is indeed the boss dragon!"



Yes, there are still many boss dragons in the robotics area. Don't slow down your step, it is time to take the sword toward the boss dragon!



You may have heard the joke of "spherical chickens in a vacuum". The fact is that what you have learned to kill a dragon works also only for "spherical dragon in a vacuum". Sorry, you do not know how to kill a real boss dragon in the battlefield.

Therefore, you need to learn more. Kill more slimes to increase your experience, upgrade your knowledge; use everything you have learned in the real applications.

You may encounter countless new problems. For example, your sword is not tough enough for "industry application" - Robot Operating System is very fragile / Orocos does not proceed  [Eigen Alignment](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicStructHavingEigenMembers.html) / No *perfect* depth sensors for industry / No low-level APIs for commercial robots.

Then, you realize that you need to rebuild your true sword.

However, this is not something you can do alone. You need a team, some people are digging coal, some are making steel, some are hitting iron, and some are sharpening the sword...

At this time, welcome to [RVBUST](http://rvbust.com/). We are waiting for your participation!
