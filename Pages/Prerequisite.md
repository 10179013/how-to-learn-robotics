Certainly, the prerequisite knowledge of robotics keeps updating with the deepening of your research, especially in mathematics. We can see math as "Sharingan", you will have different views on the same thing when you on different level of Sharingan.

With basic knowledge of robotics, you may be qualified for a position of Robot Commissioning Engineer；With the knowledge of Linear Algebra、Calculus, you are able to master the fundamental content like Kinematics、Dynamics modelling；And you can start to involve in some project work including recognition, motion planning and robot programming/teaching, after you completed studies in computing method, convex optimization and differential geometry.

However, robotics is a complex and multi-disciplinary subject,  as a result of that, the basic knowledge for different directions of robotics can be totally different. Here, instead of some general prerequisites, we won't recommend people for some "specific prerequisite", and don't get yourself trapped at the beginning. We believe you will find your direction during the processing of learning. 

So, here are some recommended basic prerequisite knowledges by myself, and all the rest knowledges will be mentioned in subsequent pages:

1. **Linear Algebra**: We need linear algebra to calculate all spatial transformation and other robotics related computations, even sort of the basic thought of「Linear Space」. Hereby, for learning linear albegra, we highly recommend the public online lectures from Prof. Gilbert Strang, which can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDFwVVKVk0&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C). This course teaches you how to look at a problem from the perspective of space instead of calculating the result only.

2. **Calculus**: In robotics, calculus is very important since we need it for all of the calculation of detivative, intergratio and optimization. It makes calculus and robotics closely related. Here we recommend you the lectures from Gilbert Strange's <[Highlights of Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/)> on MIT Open Courseware.

3. **Mechanics & Robotics**: The learning process of robotics is also a experience of learning mechanics. However, normally robotics relative textbooks won't derive theories and fomulas such as Spatial Transformation、Principle of Virtual Work (PVW)、Lagrange. Many beginners may even end up their self-learning process at here, due to the complexity and abstration of dynamics mostly. I would recommend two online courses from MIT which are free, <[Mechanics: Kinematics and Dynamics](https://www.edx.org/course/mechanics-kinematics-and-dynamics)> and <[Introduction to Robotics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-12-introduction-to-robotics-fall-2005/)>. These two courses cover almost all the topics you need for begining. If you want to take a step further, I also found these two textbooks were very useful during my learning experience, 《Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics》 & 《Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control》.

4. **Matlab or Python**: Both of these two programming languages are quite easy to get started，and implement data visulization. In the learning process of robiotics, some algrithom can be easily implemented using this kind of scripting languages to verify the derived result. At this moment, we only need to handle the operations of matrix and visulization, you can obatin the advanced usage of them in later studies. Here are two introductory courses to these two programming language from Coursera: [Matlab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab)、[Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

5. **Control Theory**: Control theory is a very important topic during studying robotics, but most of the robotics textbooks won't cover it. Currently most of the industrial robots are still using simple algrithoms, but as a researcher, it is necessary to obtain some fundamental control theories, including but not limited to PID, equation of state, objectivity, controllability, Lyapunov, optimum control and some knowledges of non-linear control and intelligent control. Here is a useful link from [Brian Douglas](www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0imsn84ShAe9PBOFnoIrg) on Youtube.

6. **Digital & Analog Circuits**: Robotics is a practical science, to ensure you have aquired the solid knowledges of robotics, you have to program your concepts into coding and control the robots to implement your algrithms. Knowledges from Diginal & analog circuits can help you to understand the fundamental of logic circuit, and is helpful for you to build a small control circuit project when you don't have an actual robot (In that situation, you can also build a simulation environment using Gazebo or ) It is very easily to find learning resources for this topic online.

7. **Microcontroller (MCU)**: For design and set up a control circuit system, besides the theories of analog & diginal circuits knowledge, you also need to know how to use them in a real circuit and control it with running some codes. A microcontroller would be a good start for that. For setting up a simple control circuit, we need more than the diginal & analog knowledges, to convert them into the circuits, to control and run the codings, then you may find that microcontroller is a very useful tool for that. To start from microcontroller, you can purchase some learnging packages with STM32 or Arduino or Raspberry pi. It would be better if you can try to participate in RoboMaster or other national/global robotics competitions, so you can have a better understanding of different modules from embedded system.

8. **Linux and C Programming**: The next step is to convert equations and codes into instructiona in circuit, to implement that, we will use embedded system programming. We recommend you to start from C programming, which is the key of embedded system, but the requirement is not that complicated, you may only need to learn some basic syntax. However, if you want to involve in some high level work or research of robotics in the future, you better need some solid knowledge in C programming. BTW, Linux, especially Ubuntu, is a great platform for learning programming, so try to start with the Linux system and learn programming with C on it. More importantly, ROS (Robot Operation System) runs on Ubuntu, and you will find C++ is also very useful for robot research and development, especially in robot vision.

9. **Basic 3D Design**: During the design of experimental platform, we usually need to machine some customized components, a CAD design software such as Solidworks can speed up the design process. 3D printer can reduce the process time of prototype machining. (3D printers are very common in North America, most of the universities provide 3D print service, even free for some of the universities. For the rest of regions, you can try to find some 3D print services online, and send your 3D file to them).

The above contents are pretty much all  of the knowledges need to obtain for third-year university students major in Automation or Mechatronics engineering student. After that, you may begin the studies of robotics.
